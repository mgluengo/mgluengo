<h1 align="center">Hi there! üëã I'm Maria</h1>
<h3 align="center"> Product Lead | Innovation Strategist | Data storyteller | API enthusiast </h3>


## About me:

I'm a Sr. Product Strategy Manager with 8+ years of working experience in IT.  

- :rocket: Passionate about **innovation** and **building new products** from ideation to launch and outreach. 
- :tophat: As a **generalist**, I like wearing many hats! I thrive at the intersections of **Product Management**, **Strategy**, **Data**, and Program Management. I enjoy exploring new, unrelated fields and connecting the dots.
- üåç  **Travel** and coffee are my drugs. I'm always on-the-go. I've been to almost 90 countries, but my bucket list is still very long!
- :books: Hobbyist writer, journalist by training, turned into **business and data storyteller**.
- üîß  Hooked to **Python** and **SQL**. Currently learning about web app development and **REST API** development with Python and Flask + building new **data projects** with SQL and Tableau.
- üí¨ Ping me about Product Management, Innovation, API Strategy, Dev Rel, Mentoring... and anything else!
